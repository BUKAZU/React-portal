    "cancel_insurance_all_risk_desc": "With All-Risk Cancellation, you will be reimbursed 100% of the cancellation costs if you cancel for a standard reason, such as an illness that prevents you from traveling. Or the death of a grandparent. Do you want to cancel for another reason that is important to you personally? Then you will be reimbursed 75% of the cancellation costs. But beware: this insurance does set a few conditions for canceling. For example, the reason for cancellation must be 'unforeseen' and 'through no fault of your own'. The insurance therefore does not provide cover for cancellation reasons of which you were already aware before taking out the insurance (not unforeseen) or which you could have done yourself (not through your own fault). Consult the conditions for the exceptions.",
